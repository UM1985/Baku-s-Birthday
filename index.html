            <p>
              The day you stepped into my home for the very first time, my heart
              felt complete. After the rituals, we went on a small car ride to
              the temple, shared chocolate with laughter, and later enjoyed
              lunch together. But the most unforgettable moment was our little
              bike ride — when you wrapped your arms around me and hugged me. In
              that moment, I knew I am the luckiest person to have you as my
              life partner. 💖

            <p>
              Our second meeting became one of the most memorable days of my
              life — my birthday. You made me feel so special with your love and
              the gifts you brought. 💝 A watch, birthday cards filled with your
              heartfelt words, a small diary, chocolates, and that handkerchief
              with a heart and our initials “UM.” Among all, that handkerchief
              became one of my most treasured gifts, a symbol of your love I’ll
              never forget. And then, of course, there was
              <em>that one special gift</em> I can never write here but will
              always carry in my heart forever. ❤️ We cut the cake together and
              celebrated not just my birthday, but the beautiful bond we were
              building. That day, I realized how lucky I am to have you by my
              side.

            <h3>🌹 Third Meeting – Dance & Park Moments</h3>
            <p>
              Our third meeting was another day I’ll always treasure. You came
              to perform a dance at a religious function — and you danced so
              beautifully, Baku. 💃 After the performance, we went to the park
              and spent so much time talking, laughing, and simply enjoying each
              other’s company. When papa called you, we rushed quickly, and I
              could see his anger. For a moment I felt that maybe I shouldn’t
              have taken you to the park… but then I realized: the joy and
              memories we created that day were worth everything. ❤️ Riding
              together on the bullet, with you hugging me tightly, made me feel
              the luckiest man alive. Even papa’s anger couldn’t take away the
              happiness of that day.

            My dearest Baku, Every moment with you feels like a beautiful dream
            that I never want to wake up from. In just a few months, you’ve
            become the rhythm of my days and the peace of my nights. I still
            remember the first time you came into my life—it was like the
            universe whispered, “Here is your forever.” Your laughter is my
            favorite song, your voice is my calm, and your hugs are the home I
            never knew I was searching for. No distance, no time, no world could
            ever keep me from cherishing you. You are my love, my strength, and
            my sweetest blessing. I don’t just want to spend time with you,
            Baku—I want to spend life with you. 💖
          </p>
